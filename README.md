# Memory Game Project

The game was created with most of the HTML and CSS provided. 

## Instructions

The game is played by opening two cards at a time until all matched are found. A timer starts when the very first card is clicked and stops when the game is won. You start with a rating of three stars which drops down to two stars after 16 moves and one star after 21 moves. A move is counted each time two cards are opened. A counter keeps track of the number of moves. When the game is won a modal pops up with the final star rating, number of moves and time in addition to asking the player if they want to play again. The game also has a restars button which can be clicked at any time. It will reset the board and shuffle all the cards.
